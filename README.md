# puppet-gluster

Puppet module for managing glusterfs.

Unlike other glusterfs modules, this one uses custom types and providers to
avoid needing multiple runs to set up interdependent resources and to
gracefully handle missing peers.

This is particularly useful when provisioning VMs with vagrant.

## WARNING

This is pretty much just a prototype at the moment. Its functionality is fairly
limited and it's almost certainly not ready for production use.


## Usage

No docs yet, sorry. It's on our list of things to do.
